Idea


A layer of abstraction build on top of playwright-js/cherio-js, with an emphasis on data extraction (instead of web application testing).

Apache Airflow (not a requirement, just interested in how applicable this framework can be for a 'small' project) for the scheduling and management of data extraction jobs.
