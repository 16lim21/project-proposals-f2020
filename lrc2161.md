### Project Description

Tool written in Python that takes user music listening data and presents it with compelling visuals.

Uses information from Spotify and other music platform's APIs to create tables and graphs to easily comprehend data that would otherwise not be accessible. Includes a visualizer that has different settings and could be played in conjuction to the users favorite songs and artists that can be easily shareable to the user's social media in the form of a short video.

### Functionality

This project would be built using Python (Flask), Javascript, and HTML/CSS primarily (open to other suggestions though) and would rely heavily on a mobile integration.

Extra Project/Feature: We want to explore creating auto-generated playlists based on a user's friend music activity; we're not sure if it is possible to access a friend's music activity though. If not, we still think creating auto-generated playlists based off a user's song library would be an interesting feature to develop.
