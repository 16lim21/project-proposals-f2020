## project ideas

### 1. A catalogue editor/viewer 
I work on the editorial team of a small art gallery (editing and printing books and stuff). Presently, the only way to see the exhibition catalogues is in hard copy. I think a web-based catalogue viewer would be easy to plug into the exisiting website and maybe rework into a mobile app later on. 

As a first step, I can create an interface that takes the contents of a single article (title, text, links to images, captions) from a database and then displays them on the frontend. Later on I can add an editor with formatting and layouts, a way to group articles into catalogues, and a library for all the catalogues. 


### 2. A word processor that supports dynamic page sizes
All the word processors I've used (Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Apple Pages) allow you to specify page sizes only for the whole document. This is a great way to ensure that the way pages appear on the screen corresponds to how they will look once they are printed out. However, I have often wished that individual pages could expand or contract dynamically to fit the text that appears in them, possibly through a mechanism similar to the existing "page break." 

For a proof of concept, I can start with a browser-based application that supports simple text editing across pages of multiple sizes. More sophisticated text formatting stuff can be added later.
