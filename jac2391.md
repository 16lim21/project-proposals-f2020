### A word processor that supports dynamic page sizes
All the word processors I've used (Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Apple Pages) allow you to specify page sizes only for the whole document. This is a great way to ensure that the way pages appear on the screen corresponds to how they will look once they are printed out. However, I have often wished that individual pages could expand or contract dynamically to fit the text that appears in them, possibly through a mechanism similar to the existing "page break."
