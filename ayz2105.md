Project idea: An all-in-one app to help roommates manage their expenses, tasks, & shared living space. Could encompass everything from splitting rent to whose groceries are whose in the fridge. Could even be fun to have roommate profiles & link up with other apartments, though that may be a long shot. Possibly especially useful for new grads living in an apartment of their own for the first time, or for students currently living off campus.

Language: Python and/or Javascript
