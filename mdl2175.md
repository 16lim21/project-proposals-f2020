# Project Ideas
Since I have two ideas for projects that I cannot choose between, I wanted to list out my motivations, objectives, and features to implement for both of them here. 

1. An application that aggregates messages from all your messaging apps (facebook messenger, slack, discord, gitter, groupme, google hangouts etc.)

2. A better/redesigned version of CULPA. 

## Motivation
1. As technology has made communication more and more accessible, so too has the number of communication methods. Nowadays, it isn't surprising to have multiple forms of preferred communication, whether that be through facebook messnger, slack, discord, gitter, groupme etc. Without any standardized communication application, I have personally found it frustrating to keep up with messages from all these sources, either needing to keep all applications open at once and cluttering up my desktop, or closing some of them only to miss important information. I would love to design an application that could not only connect to these instant messaging services, but hopefully even include notifications for other important services we often use (such as piazza, or email, or news etc.)

2. One of the most useful resources that I have depended on in my time at Columbia University has been CULPA. It's allowed me to make decisions on classes I want to take and possibly even what professors I should try to take these classes with. However, one of the problems with CULPA is that many classes are severely lacking in information, or rather, this information is quite dated. I know that many students continue to use CULPA and I think that it can be especially important for all students now that classes. I would love to create a service that strives to do what CULPA does, but mirroring the model that glassdoor follows. Making this application open source also makes sense as I believe it should continue to be built by columbia students even after I leave. 


## Objective
1. The simple purpose of this application is to be able to connect with many different applications and serve as a single communication point for all these other apps to plug into. This way, you can keep both receive and send of all your messages from one application. I would love for this application to be able to connect to all sorts of messaging services.

2. For my CULPA-like application, I would love to create a service that merges the purpose of the existing application with the model of Glassdoor. Specifically, I envision a service where, in order to see other reviews, users would need to create an account and have submitted a review through this account. This not only would incentivize writing more reviews, but it would also be a way to keep track of reviews and link them to these accounts. This way, even though users can be anonymous, if they were to write slanderous and rude reviews, they could face repercussions via a suspended or banned account. 

## Features to implement
1. A Front-end to view all the messages. The ability to log into all the messaging services independently. Hopefully able to make both a web app and mobile application (maybe even desktop application if there's enough time)

2. Ability to create accounts for users (can only create account if you have a columbia email). Only allowed to view certain reviews if you submit a review yourself (maybe have to do 1 a year). Have a certain section of reviews that are always viewable (maybe for intro classes) so that new students can still see them despite not having taken classes at Columbia. Maybe a rating system such as in glassdoor.
