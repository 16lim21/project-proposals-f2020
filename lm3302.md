## What it is

A Spotify wrapper that allows you to do basic actions with playlists that Spotify does not support, such as duplicating one of your playlists, cloning one of someone else's playlists into your account, and arranging playlists by certain orders, and so on. With visually pleasing graphics and hand-drawn UI, we want it to be friendly for college-age and younger populations to use especially.
