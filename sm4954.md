My proposal is to create a 2D graphics library that focuses on enhancing the quality of images.
The main feature is supersampling to make low resolution pictures look good in higher resolutions.
Some other features might include cleaning up grainy effects, smoothing out jagged edges, etc.
I am planning to build this in Python.
